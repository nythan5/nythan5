### Telling a little about me

- 🛠  Currently, I'm working as a Logistics Planning Assistant at Grupo Mirassol.
- 🚀  I'm studying and exploring the world of fullstack development with Python & DJANGO e DJANGO REST for API's and diving into topics like Machine Learning, etc.
- 💬  Feel free to ask me any questions!
- 👾  Fun fact about me: I began my career in electrical maintenance, but later connected the dots on how these equipment arrive in Brazil. This led me to study International Trade, which eventually introduced me to Supply Chain and the automation of tasks related to data processing. Currently, I believe I've found something that challenges me to be better every day.

### My Absolute Favorites:

- 💻 &nbsp; I'm delighted when I find a new way to accomplish something I've done before. After all, one of the paths might be blocked one day, and it's necessary to deal with day-to-day adversities.
- 📰 &nbsp; Watching TED Talks has become a hobby. Something that may seem boring to many has become a new avenue for discovering fresh ideas.
- 🍕 &nbsp; Nothing beats a good old get-together with friends. After all, over Discord, you can't feel the excitement of being with those who matter to us.
